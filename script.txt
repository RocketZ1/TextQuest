Hi there. This is a test for a visual game engine built from pygame!
You create scene scripts in the scripts.txt file following the format,
and this engine will auto generate the visual game for you including backgrounds and scene audio

This is a new scene.
The player must click to continue to the next dialog option.
You can only have upto 5 lines atm as that's just what fits the sprite/screen lol

This isn't anything to complex as I just spent a few hours making it lol
But technically you could use this to make an infinite amount of scenes that could tell a linear story
